Our mission to empower every developer on the planet extends to the Java community, and as part of that, we want to welcome Java developers across the globe to our first ever, community-focused Java conference. We rely on Java and its community more than one can imagine. From Minecraft to Azure Big Data services, across LinkedIn and Yammer and into mobile development, we also have Java developers! Come learn from and connect to a diverse and wide range of speakers as well as a sprinkling of our own.
